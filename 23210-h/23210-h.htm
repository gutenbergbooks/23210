this planet clean of
every living thing on
it,&#8221; muttered Umbo
Stetson, section chief
of Investigation &amp; Adjustment.</p>

<p>Stetson paced the landing control
bridge of his scout cruiser. His footsteps
grated on a floor that was the
rear wall of the bridge during flight.
But now the ship rested on its tail
fins&mdash;all four hundred glistening red
and black meters of it. The open
ports of the bridge looked out on
the jungle roof of Gienah III some
one hundred fifty meters below. A
butter yellow sun hung above the
horizon, perhaps an hour from setting.</p>

<p>&#8220;Clean as an egg!&#8221; he barked. He
paused in his round of the bridge,
glared out the starboard port, spat
into the fire-blackened circle that the
cruiser&#8217;s jets had burned from the
jungle.</p>

<p>The I-A section chief was dark-haired,
gangling, with large head
and big features. He stood in his
customary slouch, a stance not improved
by sacklike patched blue fatigues.
Although on this present operation
he rated the flag of a division
admiral, his fatigues carried no
insignia. There was a general unkempt,
straggling look about him.</p>

<p>Lewis Orne, junior I-A field man
with a maiden diploma, stood at the
opposite port, studying the jungle
horizon. Now and then he glanced
at the bridge control console, the
chronometer above it, the big translite
map of their position tilted from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
the opposite bulkhead. A heavy
planet native, he felt vaguely uneasy
on this Gienah III with its gravity
of only seven-eighths Terran Standard.
The surgical scars on his neck
where the micro-communications
equipment had been inserted itched
maddeningly. He scratched.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hah!&#8221; said Stetson. &#8220;Politicians!&#8221;</p>

<p>A thin black insect with shell-like
wings flew in Orne&#8217;s port, settled
in his close-cropped red hair.
Orne pulled the insect gently from
his hair, released it. Again it tried
to land in his hair. He ducked. It
flew across the bridge, out the port
beside Stetson.</p>

<p>There was a thick-muscled, no-fat
look to Orne, but something about
his blocky, off-center features suggested
a clown.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m getting tired of waiting,&#8221; he
said.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>You&#8217;re</i> tired! Hah!&#8221;</p>

<p>A breeze rippled the tops of the
green ocean below them. Here and
there, red and purple flowers jutted
from the verdure, bending and nodding
like an attentive audience.</p>

<p>&#8220;Just look at that blasted jungle!&#8221;
barked Stetson. &#8220;Them and their
stupid orders!&#8221;</p>

<p>A call bell tinkled on the bridge
control console. The red light above
the speaker grid began blinking.
Stetson shot an angry glance at it.
&#8220;Yeah, Hal?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;O.K., Stet. Orders just came
through. We use Plan C. ComGO
says to brief the field man, and jet
out of here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you ask them about using
another field man?&#8221;</p>

<p>Orne looked up attentively.</p>

<p>The speaker said: &#8220;Yes. They said
we have to use Orne because of the
records on the <i>Delphinus</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well then, will they give us
more time to brief him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Negative. It&#8217;s crash priority.
ComGO expects to blast the planet
anyway.&#8221;</p>

<p>Stetson glared at the grid. &#8220;Those
fat-headed, lard-bottomed, pig-brained
... POLITICIANS!&#8221; He
took two deep breaths, subsided.
&#8220;O.K. Tell them we&#8217;ll comply.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;One more thing, Stet.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What now?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got a confirmed contact.&#8221;</p>

<p>Instantly, Stetson was poised on
the balls of his feet, alert. &#8220;Where?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;About ten kilometers out. Section
AAB-6.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How many?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A mob. You want I should count
them?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No. What&#8217;re they doing?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Making a beeline for us. You
better get a move on.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;O.K. Keep us posted.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Right.&#8221;</p>


<p class="newsection">Stetson looked across at his junior
field man. &#8220;Orne, if you decide you
want out of this assignment, you just
say the word. I&#8217;ll back you to the
hilt.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why should I want out of my
first field assignment?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Listen, and find out.&#8221; Stetson
crossed to a tilt-locker behind the
big translite map, hauled out a white<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
coverall uniform with gold insignia,
tossed it to Orne. &#8220;Get into these
while I brief you on the map.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But this is an R&amp;R uni&mdash;&#8221; began
Orne.</p>

<p>&#8220;Get that uniform on your ugly
frame!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir, Admiral Stetson, sir.
Right away, sir. But I thought I was
through with old Rediscovery &amp; Reeducation
when you drafted me off
of Hamal into the I-A ... sir.&#8221; He
began changing from the I-A blue
to the R&amp;R white. Almost as an
afterthought, he said: &#8220;...&nbsp;Sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>A wolfish grin cracked Stetson&#8217;s
big features. &#8220;I&#8217;m soooooo happy
you have the proper attitude of subservience
toward authority.&#8221;</p>

<p>Orne zipped up the coverall uniform.
&#8220;Oh, yes, sir ... sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;O.K., Orne, pay attention.&#8221; Stetson
gestured at the map with its
green superimposed grid squares.
&#8220;Here we are. Here&#8217;s that city we
flew over on our way down. You&#8217;ll
head for it as soon as we drop you.
The place is big enough that if you
hold a course roughly northeast you
can&#8217;t miss it. We&#8217;re&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Again the call bell rang.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it this time, Hal?&#8221;
barked Stetson.</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ve changed to Plan H, Stet.
New orders cut.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Five days?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all they can give us.
ComGO says he can&#8217;t keep the information
out of High Commissioner
Bullone&#8217;s hands any longer than
that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s five days for sure then.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is this the usual R&amp;R foul-up?&#8221;
asked Orne.</p>

<p>Stetson nodded. &#8220;Thanks to Bullone
and company! We&#8217;re just one
jump ahead of catastrophe, but they
still pump the bushwah into the Rah
&amp; Rah boys back at dear old Uni-Galacta!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re making light of my revered
alma mater,&#8221; said Orne. He
struck a pose. &#8220;We must reunite the
lost planets with our centers of culture
and industry, and take up the
<i>glor</i>-ious onward march of mankind
that was so <i>bru</i>-tally&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Can it!&#8221; snapped Stetson. &#8220;We
both know we&#8217;re going to rediscover
one planet too many some day. Rim
War all over again. But this is a
different breed of fish. It&#8217;s not, repeat,
<i>not</i> a <i>re</i>-discovery.&#8221;</p>

<p>Orne sobered. &#8220;Alien?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. A-L-I-E-N! A never-before-contacted
culture. That language you
were force fed on the way over,
that&#8217;s an alien language. It&#8217;s not
complete ... all we have off the
<i>minis</i>. And we excluded data on the
natives because we&#8217;ve been hoping to
dump this project and nobody the
wiser.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Holy mazoo!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Twenty-six days ago an I-A
search ship came through here, had
a routine mini-sneaker look at the
place. When he combed in his net
of sneakers to check the tapes and
films, lo and behold, he had a little
stranger.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;One of <i>theirs</i>?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No. It was a <i>mini</i> off the <i>Delphinus
Rediscovery</i>. The <i>Delphinus</i> has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
been unreported for eighteen standard
months!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did it crack up here?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t know. If it did, we
haven&#8217;t been able to spot it. She
was supposed to be way off in the
Balandine System by now. But we&#8217;ve
something else on our minds. It&#8217;s
the one item that makes me want to
blot out this place, and run home
with my tail between my legs.
We&#8217;ve a&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Again the call bell chimed.</p>

<p>&#8220;NOW WHAT?&#8221; roared Stetson
into the speaker.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got a <i>mini</i> over that mob,
Stet. They&#8217;re talking about us. It&#8217;s a
definite raiding party.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What armament?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Too gloomy in that jungle to be
sure. The infra beam&#8217;s out on this
<i>mini</i>. Looks like hard pellet rifles
of some kind. Might even be off the
<i>Delphinus</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t you get closer?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wouldn&#8217;t do any good. No light
down there, and they&#8217;re moving up
fast.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Keep an eye on them, but don&#8217;t
ignore the other sectors,&#8221; said Stetson.</p>

<p>&#8220;You think I was born yesterday?&#8221;
barked the voice from the
grid. The contact broke off with an
angry sound.</p>


<p class="newsection">&#8220;One thing I like about the I-A,&#8221;
said Stetson. &#8220;It collects such even-tempered
types.&#8221; He looked at the
white uniform on Orne, wiped a
hand across his mouth as though he&#8217;d
tasted something dirty.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why <i>am</i> I wearing this thing?&#8221;
asked Orne.</p>

<p>&#8220;Disguise.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But there&#8217;s no mustache!&#8221;</p>

<p>Stetson smiled without humor.
&#8220;That&#8217;s one of I-A&#8217;s answers to those
fat-keistered politicians. We&#8217;re setting
up our own search system to
find the planets before <i>they</i> do.
We&#8217;ve managed to put spies in key
places at R&amp;R. Any touchy planets
our spies report, we divert the files.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then what?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then we look into them with
bright boys like you&mdash;disguised as
R&amp;R field men.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Goody, goody. And what happens
if R&amp;R stumbles onto me
while I&#8217;m down there playing patty
cake?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We disown you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you said an I-A ship found
this joint.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It did. And then one of our spies
in R&amp;R intercepted a <i>routine</i> request
for an agent-instructor to be assigned
here with full equipment. Request
signed by a First-Contact officer
name of Diston ... of the <i>Delphinus</i>!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But the Del&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yeah. Missing. The request was
a forgery. Now you see why I&#8217;m
mostly for rubbing out this place.
Who&#8217;d dare forge such a thing unless
he knew for sure that the original
FC officer was missing ... or
dead?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What the jumped up mazoo are
we doing here, Stet?&#8221; asked Orne.
&#8220;Alien calls for a full contact team
with all of the&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p><p>&#8220;It calls for one planet-buster
bomb ... buster&mdash;in five days. Unless
you give them a white bill in
the meantime. High Commissioner
Bullone will have word of this
planet by then. If Gienah III still
exists in five days, can&#8217;t you imagine
the fun the politicians&#8217;ll have with
it? Mama mia! We want this planet
cleared for contact or dead before
then.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t like this, Stet.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;YOU don&#8217;t like it!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Look,&#8221; said Orne. &#8220;There must
be another way. Why ... when we
teamed up with the Alerinoids we
gained five hundred years in the
physical sciences alone, not to mention
the&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The Alerinoids didn&#8217;t knock
over one of our survey ships first.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What if the <i>Delphinus</i> just
crashed here ... and the locals picked
up the pieces?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what you&#8217;re going in to
find out, Orne. But answer me this:
If they <i>do</i> have the <i>Delphinus</i>, how
long before a tool-using race could
be a threat to the galaxy?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I saw that city they built, Stet.
They could be dug in within six
months, and there&#8217;d be no&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yeah.&#8221;</p>

<p>Orne shook his head. &#8220;But think
of it: Two civilizations that matured
along different lines! Think of all
the different ways we&#8217;d approach the
same problems ... the lever that&#8217;d
give us for&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You sound like a Uni-Galacta
lecture! Are you through marching
arm in arm into the misty future?&#8221;</p>

<p>Orne took a deep breath. &#8220;Why&#8217;s
a freshman like me being tossed into
this dish?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d still be on the <i>Delphinus</i>
master lists as an R&amp;R field man.
That&#8217;s important if you&#8217;re masquerading.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Am I the only one? I know I&#8217;m
a recent <i>convert</i>, but&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You want out?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t say that. I just want to
know why I&#8217;m&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Because the bigdomes fed a set
of requirements into one of their
iron monsters. Your card popped out.
They were looking for somebody
capable, dependable ... and ...
<i>expendable</i>!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hey!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s why I&#8217;m down here briefing
you instead of sitting back on a
flagship. <i>I</i> got you into the I-A.
Now, you listen carefully: If you
push the panic button on this one
without cause, I will personally flay
you alive. We both know the advantages
of an alien contact. But if you
get into a hot spot, and call for help,
I&#8217;ll dive this cruiser into that city to
get you out!&#8221;</p>

<p>Orne swallowed. &#8220;Thanks, Stet.
I&#8217;m&mdash;&#8221;</p>


<p class="newsection">&#8220;We&#8217;re going to take up a tight
orbit. Out beyond us will be five
transports full of I-A marines and a
Class IX Monitor with one planet-buster.
You&#8217;re calling the shots, God
help you! First, we want to know if
they have the <i>Delphinus</i> ... and if
so, where it is. Next, we want to
know just how warlike these goons<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
are. Can we control them if they&#8217;re
bloodthirsty. What&#8217;s their potential?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In five days?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not a second more.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do we know about them?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not much. They look something
like an ancient Terran chimpanzee
... only with blue fur. Face is hairless,
pink-skinned.&#8221; Stetson snapped
a switch. The translite map became
a screen with a figure frozen on it.
&#8220;Like that. This is life size.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Looks like the missing link
they&#8217;re always hunting for,&#8221; said
Orne. &#8220;Yeah, but you&#8217;ve got a different
kind of a missing link.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Vertical-slit pupils in their eyes,&#8221;
said Orne. He studied the figure. It
had been caught from the front by
a mini-sneaker camera. About five
feet tall. The stance was slightly
bent forward, long arms. Two vertical
nose slits. A flat, lipless mouth.
Receding chin. Four-fingered hands.
It wore a wide belt from which dangled
neat pouches and what looked
like tools, although their use was
obscure. There appeared to be the
tip of a tail protruding from behind
one of the squat legs. Behind the
creature towered the faery spires of
the city they&#8217;d observed from the air.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tails?&#8221; asked Orne.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yeah. They&#8217;re arboreal. Not a
road on the whole planet that we
can find. But there are lots of vine
lanes through the jungles.&#8221; Stetson&#8217;s
face hardened. &#8220;Match <i>that</i> with a
city as advanced as that one.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Slave culture?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Probably.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How many cities have they?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve found two. This one and
another on the other side of the
planet. But the other one&#8217;s a
ruin.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A ruin? Why?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You tell us. Lots of mysteries
here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the planet like?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mostly jungle. There are polar
oceans, lakes and rivers. One low
mountain chain follows the equatorial
belt about two thirds around the
planet.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But only two cities. Are you
sure?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Reasonably so. It&#8217;d be pretty hard
to miss something the size of that
thing we flew over. It must be fifty
kilometers long and at least ten wide.
Swarming with these creatures, too.
We&#8217;ve got a zone-count estimate that
places the city&#8217;s population at over
thirty million.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Whee-ew! Those are tall buildings, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t know much about this
place, Orne. And unless you bring
them into the fold, there&#8217;ll be nothing
but ashes for our archaeologists
to pick over.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Seems a dirty shame.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I agree, but&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>The call bell jangled.</p>


<p class="newsection">Stetson&#8217;s voice sounded tired:
&#8220;Yeah, Hal?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That mob&#8217;s only about five kilometers
out, Stet. We&#8217;ve got Orne&#8217;s
gear outside in the disguised air
sled.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll be right down.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p><p>&#8220;Why a disguised sled?&#8221; asked
Orne.</p>

<p>&#8220;If they think it&#8217;s a ground buggy,
they might get careless when you
most need an advantage. We could
always scoop you out of the air, you
know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;re my chances on this one,
Stet?&#8221;</p>

<p>Stetson shrugged. &#8220;I&#8217;m afraid
they&#8217;re slim. These goons probably
have the <i>Delphinus</i>, and they want
you just long enough to get your
equipment and everything you
know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Rough as that, eh?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;According to our best guess. If
you&#8217;re not out in five days, we blast.&#8221;</p>

<p>Orne cleared his throat.</p>

<p>&#8220;Want out?&#8221; asked Stetson.</p>

<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Use the <i>back-door</i> rule, son. Always
leave yourself a way out. Now
... let&#8217;s check that equipment the
surgeons put in your neck.&#8221; Stetson
put a hand to his throat. His mouth
remained closed, but there was a
surf-hissing voice in Orne&#8217;s ears:
&#8220;You read me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure. I can&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No!&#8221; hissed the voice. &#8220;Touch
the mike contact. Keep your mouth
closed. Just use your speaking muscles
without speaking.&#8221;</p>

<p>Orne obeyed.</p>

<p>&#8220;O.K.,&#8221; said Stetson. &#8220;You come
in loud and clear.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I ought to. I&#8217;m right on top of
you!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;ll be a relay ship over you
all the time,&#8221; said Stetson. &#8220;Now ...
when you&#8217;re not touching that mike
contact this rig&#8217;ll still feed us what
you say ... and everything that goes
on around you, too. We&#8217;ll monitor
everything. Got that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>Stetson held out his right hand.
&#8220;Good luck. I meant that about diving
in for you. Just say the word.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know the word, too,&#8221; said
Orne. &#8220;HELP!&#8221;</p>


<p class="newsection">Gray mud floor and gloomy aisles
between monstrous bluish tree
trunks&mdash;that was the jungle. Only
the barest weak glimmering of sunlight
penetrated to the mud. The
disguised sled&mdash;its para-grav units
turned off&mdash;lurched and skidded
around buttress roots. Its headlights
swung in wild arcs across the trunks
and down to the mud. Aerial creepers&mdash;great
looping vines of them&mdash;swung
down from the towering
forest ceiling. A steady drip of condensation
spattered the windshield,
forcing Orne to use the wipers.</p>

<p>In the bucket seat of the sled&#8217;s
cab, Orne fought the controls. He
was plagued by the vague slow-motion-floating
sensation that a
heavy planet native always feels in
lighter gravity. It gave him an unhappy
stomach.</p>

<p>Things skipped through the air
around the lurching vehicle: flitting
and darting things. Insects came in
twin cones, siphoned toward the
headlights. There was an endless
chittering whistling tok-tok-toking
in the gloom beyond the lights.</p>

<p>Stetson&#8217;s voice hissed suddenly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
through the surgically implanted
speaker: &#8220;How&#8217;s it look?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Alien.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Any sign of that mob?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Negative.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;O.K. We&#8217;re taking off.&#8221;</p>

<p>Behind Orne, there came a deep
rumbling roar that receded as the
scout cruiser climbed its jets. All
other sounds hung suspended in
after-silence, then resumed: the
strongest first and then the weakest.</p>

<p>A heavy object suddenly arced
through the headlights, swinging on
a vine. It disappeared behind a tree.
Another. Another. Ghostly shadows
with vine pendulums on both sides.
Something banged down heavily
onto the hood of the sled.</p>

<div style="width:525px; margin:auto;">

</div>


<p>Orne braked to a creaking stop
that shifted the load behind him,
found himself staring through the
windshield at a native of Gienah III.
The native crouched on the hood, a
Mark XX exploding-pellet rifle in
his right hand directed at Orne&#8217;s
head. In the abrupt shock of meeting,
Orne recognized the weapon:
standard issue to the marine guards
on all R&amp;R survey ships.</p>

<p>The native appeared the twin of
the one Orne had seen on the translite
screen. The four-fingered hand
looked extremely capable around the
stock of the Mark XX.</p>

<p>Slowly, Orne put a hand to his
throat, pressed the contact button.
He moved his speaking muscles:
<i>&#8220;Just made contact with the mob.
One on the hood now has one of
our Mark XX rifles aimed at my
head.&#8221;</i></p>

<p>The surf-hissing of Stetson&#8217;s voice
came through the hidden speaker:
<i>&#8220;Want us to come back?&#8221;</i></p>

<p><i>&#8220;Negative. Stand by. He looks
cautious rather than hostile.&#8221;</i></p>

<p>Orne held up his right hand, palm
out. He had a second thought: held
up his left hand, too. Universal
symbol of peaceful intentions: empty
hands. The gun muzzle lowered
slightly. Orne called into his mind
the language that had been hypnoforced
into him. <i>Ocheero? No. That
means &#8216;The People.&#8217; Ah&nbsp;...</i> And he
had the heavy fricative greeting
sound.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ffroiragrazzi,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>The native shifted to the left, answered
in pure, unaccented High
Galactese: &#8220;Who are you?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p><p>Orne fought down a sudden panic.
The lipless mouth had looked so odd
forming the familiar words.</p>

<p>Stetson&#8217;s voice hissed: <i>&#8220;Is that the
native speaking Galactese?&#8221;</i></p>

<p>Orne touched his throat. <i>&#8220;You
heard him.&#8221;</i></p>

<p>He dropped his hand, said: &#8220;I am
Lewis Orne of Rediscovery and Reeducation.
I was sent here at the
request of the First-Contact officer
on the <i>Delphinus Rediscovery</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where is your ship?&#8221; demanded
the Gienahn.</p>

<p>&#8220;It put me down and left.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was behind schedule for another
appointment.&#8221;</p>


<p class="newsection">Out of the corners of his eyes,
Orne saw more shadows dropping to
the mud around him. The sled shifted
as someone climbed onto the load
behind the cab. The someone scuttled
agilely for a moment.</p>

<p>The native climbed down to the
cab&#8217;s side step, opened the door. The
rifle was held at the ready. Again,
the lipless mouth formed Galactese
words: &#8220;What do you carry in this
... vehicle?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The equipment every R&amp;R field
man uses to help the people of a
rediscovered planet improve themselves.&#8221;
Orne nodded at the rifle.
&#8220;Would you mind pointing that
weapon some other direction? It
makes me nervous.&#8221;</p>

<p>The gun muzzle remained unwaveringly
on Orne&#8217;s middle. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
native&#8217;s mouth opened, revealing
long canines. &#8220;Do we not look
strange to you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I take it there&#8217;s been a heavy
mutational variation in the humanoid
norm on this planet,&#8221; said Orne.
&#8220;What is it? Hard radiation?&#8221;</p>

<p>No answer.</p>

<p>&#8220;It doesn&#8217;t really make any difference,
of course,&#8221; said Orne. &#8220;I&#8217;m
here to help you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am Tanub, High Path Chief of
the Grazzi,&#8221; said the native. &#8220;I decide
who is to help.&#8221;</p>

<p>Orne swallowed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where do you go?&#8221; demanded
Tanub.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was hoping to go to your city.
Is it permitted?&#8221;</p>

<p>A long pause while the vertical-slit
pupils of Tanub&#8217;s eyes expanded
and contracted. &#8220;It is permitted.&#8221;</p>

<p>Stetson&#8217;s voice came through the
hidden speaker: <i>&#8220;All bets off. We&#8217;re
coming in after you. That Mark XX
is the final straw. It means they have
the</i> Delphinus <i>for sure!&#8221;</i></p>

<p>Orne touched his throat. <i>&#8220;No!
Give me a little more time!&#8221;</i></p>

<p><i>&#8220;Why?&#8221;</i></p>

<p><i>&#8220;I have a hunch about these creatures.&#8221;</i></p>

<p><i>&#8220;What is it?&#8221;</i></p>

<p><i>&#8220;No time now. Trust me.&#8221;</i></p>

<p>Another long pause in which
Orne and Tanub continued to study
each other. Presently, Stetson said:
<i>&#8220;O.K. Go ahead as planned. But find
out where the</i> Delphinus <i>is! If we
get that back we pull their teeth.&#8221;</i></p>

<p>&#8220;Why do you keep touching your
throat?&#8221; demanded Tanub.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m nervous,&#8221; said Orne. &#8220;Guns
always make me nervous.&#8221;</p>

<p>The muzzle lowered slightly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Shall we continue on to your
city?&#8221; asked Orne. He wet his lips
with his tongue. The cab light on
Tanub&#8217;s face was giving the Gienahn
an eerie sinister look.</p>

<p>&#8220;We can go soon,&#8221; said Tanub.</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you join me inside here?&#8221;
asked Orne. &#8220;There&#8217;s a passenger
seat right behind me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tanub&#8217;s eyes moved catlike: right,
left. &#8220;Yes.&#8221; He turned, barked an
order into the jungle gloom, then
climbed in behind Orne.</p>

<p>&#8220;When do we go?&#8221; asked Orne.</p>

<p>&#8220;The great sun will be down
soon,&#8221; said Tanub. &#8220;We can continue
as soon as Chiranachuruso
rises.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Chiranachuruso?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Our satellite ... our moon,&#8221; said
Tanub.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a beautiful word,&#8221; said Orne.
&#8220;Chiranachuruso.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In our tongue it means: The
Limb of Victory,&#8221; said Tanub. &#8220;By
its light we will continue.&#8221;</p>

<p>Orne turned, looked back at Tanub.
&#8220;Do you mean to tell me that
you can see by what light gets down
here through those trees?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Can you not see?&#8221; asked Tanub.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not without the headlights.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Our eyes differ,&#8221; said Tanub. He
bent toward Orne, peered. The vertical
slit pupils of his eyes expanded,
contracted. &#8220;You are the same as the
... others.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, on the <i>Delphinus</i>?&#8221;</p>

<p>Pause. &#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span></p><p>Presently, a greater gloom came
over the jungle, bringing a sudden
stillness to the wild life. There was
a chittering commotion from the
natives in the trees around the sled.
Tanub shifted behind Orne.</p>

<p>&#8220;We may go now,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;Slowly ... to stay behind my ...
scouts.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Right.&#8221; Orne eased the sled
forward around an obstructing
root.</p>


<p class="newsection">Silence while they crawled ahead.
Around them shapes flung themselves
from vine to vine.</p>

<p>&#8220;I admired your city from the
air,&#8221; said Orne. &#8220;It is very beautiful.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Tanub. &#8220;Why did you
land so far from it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We didn&#8217;t want to come down
where we might destroy anything.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There is nothing to destroy in
the jungle,&#8221; said Tanub.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why do you have such a big
city?&#8221; asked Orne.</p>

<p>Silence.</p>

<p>&#8220;I said: Why do you&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are ignorant of our ways,&#8221;
said Tanub. &#8220;Therefore, I forgive
you. The city is for our race. We
must breed and be born in sunlight.
Once&mdash;long ago&mdash;we used crude
platforms on the tops of the trees.
Now ... only the ... wild ones
do this.&#8221;</p>

<p>Stetson&#8217;s voice hissed in Orne&#8217;s
ears: <i>&#8220;Easy on the sex line, boy.
That&#8217;s always touchy. These creatures
are oviparous. Sex glands are
apparently hidden in that long fur
behind where their chins ought to
be.&#8221;</i></p>

<p>&#8220;Who controls the breeding sites
controls our world,&#8221; said Tanub.
&#8220;Once there was another city. We
destroyed it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are there many ... wild ones?&#8221;
asked Orne.</p>

<p>&#8220;Fewer each year,&#8221; said Tanub.</p>

<p><i>&#8220;There&#8217;s how they get their
slaves,&#8221;</i> hissed Stetson.</p>

<p>&#8220;You speak excellent Galactese,&#8221;
said Orne.</p>

<p>&#8220;The High Path Chief commanded
the best teacher,&#8221; said Tanub.
&#8220;Do you, too, know many things,
Orne?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s why I was sent here,&#8221;
said Orne.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are there many planets to
teach?&#8221; asked Tanub.</p>

<p>&#8220;Very many,&#8221; said Orne. &#8220;Your
city&mdash;I saw very tall buildings. Of
what do you build them?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In your tongue&mdash;glass,&#8221; said
Tanub. &#8220;The engineers of the <i>Delphinus</i>
said it was impossible. As
you saw&mdash;they are wrong.&#8221;</p>

<p><i>&#8220;A glass-blowing culture,&#8221;</i> hissed
Stetson. <i>&#8220;That&#8217;d explain a lot of
things.&#8221;</i></p>

<p>Slowly, the disguised sled crept
through the jungle. Once, a scout
swooped down into the headlights,
waved. Orne stopped on Tanub&#8217;s order,
and they waited almost ten minutes
before proceeding.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wild ones?&#8221; asked Orne.</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps,&#8221; said Tanub.</p>

<p>A glowing of many lights grew
visible through the giant tree trunks.
It grew brighter as the sled crept<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
through the last of the jungle,
emerged in cleared land at the edge
of the city.</p>

<p>Orne stared upward in awe. The
city fluted and spiraled into the
moonlit sky. It was a fragile appearing
lacery of bridges, winking dots
of light. The bridges wove back and
forth from building to building until
the entire visible network appeared
one gigantic dew-glittering web.</p>

<p>&#8220;All that with glass,&#8221; murmured
Orne.</p>

<p><i>&#8220;What&#8217;s happening?&#8221;</i> hissed Stetson.</p>

<p>Orne touched his throat contact.
<i>&#8220;We&#8217;re just into the city clearing,
proceeding toward the nearest building.&#8221;</i></p>

<p>&#8220;This is far enough,&#8221; said Tanub.</p>


<p class="newsection">Orne stopped the sled. In the
moonlight, he could see armed Gienahns
all around. The buttressed
pedestal of one of the buildings
loomed directly ahead. It looked taller
than had the scout cruiser in its
jungle landing circle.</p>

<p>Tanub leaned close to Orne&#8217;s
shoulder. &#8220;We have not deceived
you, have we, Orne?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Huh? What do you mean?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have recognized that we are
not mutated members of your
race.&#8221;</p>

<p>Orne swallowed. Into his ears
came Stetson&#8217;s voice: <i>&#8220;Better admit
it.&#8221;</i></p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s true,&#8221; said Orne.</p>

<p>&#8220;I like you, Orne,&#8221; said Tanub.
&#8220;You shall be one of my slaves. You
will teach me many things.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How did you capture the <i>Delphinus</i>?&#8221;
asked Orne.</p>

<p>&#8220;You know that, too?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have one of their rifles,&#8221;
said Orne.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your race is no match for us,
Orne ... in cunning, in strength, in
the prowess of the mind. Your ship
landed to repair its tubes. Very inferior
ceramics in those tubes.&#8221;</p>

<p>Orne turned, looked at Tanub in
the dim glow of the cab light. &#8220;Have
you heard about the I-A, Tanub?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I-A? What is that?&#8221; There was a
wary tenseness in the Gienahn&#8217;s figure.
His mouth opened to reveal the
long canines.</p>

<p>&#8220;You took the <i>Delphinus</i> by
treachery?&#8221; asked Orne.</p>

<p>&#8220;They were simple fools,&#8221; said
Tanub. &#8220;We are smaller, thus they
thought us weaker.&#8221; The Mark XX&#8217;s
muzzle came around to center on
Orne&#8217;s stomach. &#8220;You have not answered
my question. What is the
I-A?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am of the I-A,&#8221; said Orne.
&#8220;Where&#8217;ve you hidden the <i>Delphinus</i>?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In the place that suits us best,&#8221;
said Tanub. &#8220;In all our history there
has never been a better place.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you plan to do with
it?&#8221; asked Orne.</p>

<p>&#8220;Within a year we will have a
copy with our own improvements.
After that&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You intend to start a war?&#8221; asked
Orne.</p>

<p>&#8220;In the jungle the strong slay the
weak until only the strong remain,&#8221;
said Tanub.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span></p><p>&#8220;And then the strong prey upon
each other?&#8221; asked Orne.</p>

<p>&#8220;That is a quibble for women,&#8221;
said Tanub.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s too bad you feel that way,&#8221;
said Orne. &#8220;When two cultures meet
like this they tend to help each
other. What have you done with the
crew of the <i>Delphinus</i>?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They are slaves,&#8221; said Tanub.
&#8220;Those who still live. Some resisted.
Others objected to teaching us what
we want to know.&#8221; He waved the
gun muzzle. &#8220;You will not be that
foolish, will you, Orne?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No need to be,&#8221; said Orne. &#8220;I&#8217;ve
another little lesson to teach you: I
already know where you&#8217;ve hidden
the <i>Delphinus</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p><i>&#8220;Go, boy!&#8221;</i> hissed Stetson.
<i>&#8220;Where is it?&#8221;</i></p>

<p>&#8220;Impossible!&#8221; barked Tanub.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s on your moon,&#8221; said Orne.
&#8220;Darkside. It&#8217;s on a mountain on the
darkside of your moon.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tanub&#8217;s eyes dilated, contracted.
&#8220;You read minds?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The I-A has no need to read
minds,&#8221; said Orne. &#8220;We rely on superior
mental prowess.&#8221;</p>

<p><i>&#8220;The marines are on their way,&#8221;</i>
hissed Stetson. <i>&#8220;We&#8217;re coming in to
get you. I&#8217;m going to want to know
how you guessed that one.&#8221;</i></p>

<p>&#8220;You are a weak fool like the
others,&#8221; gritted Tanub.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s too bad you formed your
opinion of us by observing only the
low grades of the R&amp;R,&#8221; said Orne.</p>

<p><i>&#8220;Easy, boy,&#8221;</i> hissed Stetson.
<i>&#8220;Don&#8217;t pick a fight with him now.
Remember, his race is arboreal. He&#8217;s
probably as strong as an ape.&#8221;</i></p>

<p>&#8220;I could kill you where you sit!&#8221;
grated Tanub.</p>

<p>&#8220;You write finish for your entire
planet if you do,&#8221; said Orne. &#8220;I&#8217;m
not alone. There are others listening
to every word we say. There&#8217;s a ship
overhead that could split open your
planet with one bomb&mdash;wash it with
molten rock. It&#8217;d run like the glass
you use for your buildings.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are lying!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll make you an offer,&#8221; said
Orne. &#8220;We don&#8217;t really want to exterminate
you. We&#8217;ll give you limited
membership in the Galactic Federation
until you prove you&#8217;re no menace
to us.&#8221;</p>

<p><i>&#8220;Keep talking,&#8221;</i> hissed Stetson.
<i>&#8220;Keep him interested.&#8221;</i></p>

<p>&#8220;You dare insult me!&#8221; growled
Tanub.</p>

<p>&#8220;You had better believe me,&#8221; said
Orne. &#8220;We&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Stetson&#8217;s voice interrupted him:
<i>&#8220;Got it, Orne! They caught the</i>
Delphinus <i>on the ground right where
you said it&#8217;d be! Blew the tubes off
it. Marines now mopping up.&#8221;</i></p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s like this,&#8221; said Orne. &#8220;We
already have recaptured the <i>Delphinus</i>.&#8221;
Tanub&#8217;s eyes went instinctively
skyward. &#8220;Except for the captured
armament you still hold, you obviously
don&#8217;t have the weapons to
meet us,&#8221; continued Orne. &#8220;Otherwise,
you wouldn&#8217;t be carrying that
rifle off the <i>Delphinus</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If you speak the truth, then we
shall die bravely,&#8221; said Tanub.</p>

<p>&#8220;No need for you to die,&#8221; said
Orne.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span></p><p>&#8220;Better to die than be slaves,&#8221;
said Tanub.</p>

<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t need slaves,&#8221; said
Orne. &#8220;We&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I cannot take the chance that you
are lying,&#8221; said Tanub. &#8220;I must kill
you now.&#8221;</p>


<p class="newsection">Orne&#8217;s foot rested on the air sled
control pedal. He depressed it. Instantly,
the sled shot skyward, heavy
G&#8217;s pressing them down into the
seats. The gun in Tanub&#8217;s hands was
slammed into his lap. He struggled
to raise it. To Orne, the weight was
still only about twice that of his
home planet of Chargon. He reached
over, took the rifle, found safety
belts, bound Tanub with them. Then
he eased off the acceleration.</p>

<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t need slaves,&#8221; said
Orne. &#8220;We have machines to do our
work. We&#8217;ll send experts in here,
teach you people how to exploit your
planet, how to build good transportation
facilities, show you how to
mine your minerals, how to&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And what do we do in return?&#8221;
whispered Tanub.</p>

<p>&#8220;You could start by teaching us
how you make superior glass,&#8221; said
Orne. &#8220;I certainly hope you see
things our way. We really don&#8217;t want
to have to come down there and
clean you out. It&#8217;d be a shame to
have to blast that city into little
pieces.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tanub wilted. Presently, he said:
&#8220;Send me back. I will discuss this
with ... our council.&#8221; He stared at
Orne. &#8220;You I-A&#8217;s are too strong.
We did not know.&#8221;</p>


<p class="newsection">In the wardroom of Stetson&#8217;s
scout cruiser, the lights were low,
the leather chairs comfortable, the
green beige table set with a decanter
of Hochar brandy and two
glasses.</p>

<p>Orne lifted his glass, sipped the
liquor, smacked his lips. &#8220;For a while
there, I thought I&#8217;d never be tasting
anything like this again.&#8221;</p>

<p>Stetson took his own glass. &#8220;ComGO
heard the whole thing over the
general monitor net,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;D&#8217;you know you&#8217;ve been breveted
to senior field man?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, they&#8217;ve already recognized
my sterling worth,&#8221; said Orne.</p>

<p>The wolfish grin took over Stetson&#8217;s
big features. &#8220;Senior field men
last about half as long as the juniors,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;Mortality&#8217;s terrific?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I might&#8217;ve known,&#8221; said Orne.
He took another sip of the brandy.</p>

<p>Stetson flicked on the switch of a
recorder beside him. &#8220;O.K. You can
go ahead any time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where do you want me to start?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;First, how&#8217;d you spot right away
where they&#8217;d hidden the <i>Delphinus</i>?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Easy. Tanub&#8217;s word for his people
was <i>Grazzi</i>. Most races call themselves
something meaning <i>The People</i>.
But in his tongue that&#8217;s <i>Ocheero</i>.
<i>Grazzi</i> wasn&#8217;t on the translated list.
I started working on it. The most
likely answer was that it had been
adopted from another language, and
meant <i>enemy</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And <i>that</i> told you where the
<i>Delphinus</i> was?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No. But it fitted my hunch about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
these Gienahns. I&#8217;d kind of felt
from the first minute of meeting
them that they had a culture like the
Indians of ancient Terra.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They came in like a primitive
raiding party. The leader dropped
right onto the hood of my sled. An
act of bravery, no less. Counting
coup, you see?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess so.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then he said he was High Path
Chief. That wasn&#8217;t on the language
list, either. But it was easy: <i>Raider
Chief.</i> There&#8217;s a word in almost
every language in history that means
raider and derives from a word for
road, path or highway.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Highwaymen,&#8221; said Stetson.</p>

<p>&#8220;Raid itself,&#8221; said Orne. &#8220;An ancient
Terran language corruption of
road.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yeah, yeah. But where&#8217;d all this
translation griff put&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be impatient. Glass-blowing
culture meant they were just out
of the primitive stage. That, we
could control. Next, he said their
moon was <i>Chiranachuruso</i>, translated
as <i>The Limb of Victory</i>. After that
it just fell into place.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The vertical-slit pupils of their
eyes. Doesn&#8217;t that mean anything to
you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe. What&#8217;s it mean to you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Night-hunting predator accustomed
to dropping upon its victims
from above. No other type of creature
ever has had the vertical slit.
And Tanub said himself that the
<i>Delphinus</i> was hidden in the best
place in all of their history. History?
That&#8217;d be a high place. Dark, likewise.
Ergo: a high place on the darkside
of their moon.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m a pie-eyed greepus,&#8221; whispered
Stetson.</p>

<p>Orne grinned, said: &#8220;You probably
are ... sir.&#8221;</p>
